Outdoor Journal Web App

For a while I had been using a notebook so I could write down and keep track of notes, thoughts, and general observations I had while I was out hiking, camping, hunting, and fishing.

Then I had the idea of setting up a web app for my future journal but since I didn't want just anyone looking at my notes I wanted to make sure there was a safe and secure authentication and authorization system to handle the data.
